## Usage
To use images from uploadcare, specify the provider as `uploadcare` and set the image src to the UUID provided on the dashboard.

```vue [page.vue]
<NuxtImg
  provider="uploadcare"
  src="c160afba-8b42-45a9-a46a-d393248b0072"
  alt="My image from uploadcare"
/>
```

## Configuration

> By default, all file URLs use the `ucarecdn.com` domain. By setting a custom CDN CNAME, file URLs can use `cdn.mycompany.com` instead.

See the [Uploadcare documentation](https://uploadcare.com/docs/delivery/cdn/#custom-cdn-cname) for how to enable a custom domain in your project. To tell Nuxt Image about the custom CDN name, use the following configuration:

```ts  [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  image: {
    uploadcare: {
      cdnURL: 'cdn.mycompany.com',
    }
  }
})
```
