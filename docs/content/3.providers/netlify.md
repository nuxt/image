Netlifyâ€™s Large Media service is [deprecated](https://answers.netlify.com/t/large-media-feature-deprecated-but-not-removed/100804). If this feature is already enabled, Large Media will continue to work on these sites as usual. New Large Media configuration is not recommended.
::

Netlify offers dynamic image transformation for all JPEG, PNG, and GIF files you have set to be tracked with [Netlify Large Media](https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/overview/).

::callout
Before setting `provider: 'netlify'`, make sure you have followed the steps to enable [Netlify Large Media](https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/overview/).

## Modifiers

In addition to `height` and `width`, the Netlify provider supports the following modifiers:

### `fit`

* **Default**: `contain`
* **Valid options**: `contain` (equivalent to `nf_resize=fit`) and `fill` (equivalent to `nf_resize=smartcrop`)
