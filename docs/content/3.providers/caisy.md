Integration between [Caisy](https://caisy.io/) and the image module.

To use this provider you just need to specify the base URL of your project.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  image: {
    caisy: {},
  },
});
```

## Modifiers

All the default modifiers from [Caisy's documentation](https://caisy.io/developer/docs/libraries/rendering-images) are available.
