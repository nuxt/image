`<nuxt-img>` is a drop-in replacement for the native `<img>` tag.

::list
- Uses built-in provider to optimize local and remote images
- Converts `src` to provider optimized URLs
- Automatically resizes images based on `width` and `height`
- Generates responsive sizes when providing `sizes` option
- Supports native lazy loading as well as other `<img>` attributes
::

## Usage

`nuxt-img` outputs a native `img` tag directly (without any wrapper around it). Use it like you would use the `<img>` tag:

```html
<nuxt-img src="/nuxt-icon.png" />
```

Will result in:

```html
<img src="/nuxt-icon.png" />
```

::alert{type="info"}
With [default provider](/providers/introduction#default-provider), you should put `/nuxt-icon.png` inside `public/` directory for Nuxt 3 make the above example work.
::

## Props

### `src`

Path to image file

`src` should be in the form of an absolute path for static images in `public/` directory.
Otherwise path that is expected by provider that starts with `/` or a URL.

```html
<nuxt-img src="/nuxt.png" />
```

For image optimization when using external urls in `src`, we need to whitelist them using [`domains`](/configuration#domains) option.

### `width` / `height`

Specify width/height of the image.

- Use desired width/height for static sized images like icons or avatars
- Use original image width/height for responsive images (when using [`sizes`](#sizes))

### `sizes`

Specify responsive sizes.

This a space-separated list of screen size/width pairs. You can [see a list of the defined screen sizes here](/configuration#screens)).

**Example:**

```html
<nuxt-img
  src="/logos/nuxt.png"
  sizes="sm:100vw md:50vw lg:400px"
  />
```

### `provider`

Use other provider instead of default [provider option](/configuration#provider) specified in `nuxt.config`

**Example:**

::code-group

  ```html [index.vue]
  <template>
    <nuxt-img
      provider="cloudinary"
      src="/remote/nuxt-org/blog/going-full-static/main.png"
      width="300"
      height="169"
    />
  </template>
  ```

  ```js [nuxt.config.js]
  export default {
    image: {
      cloudinary: {
        baseURL: "https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/image/upload/",
      },
    },
  };
  ```

::

### `preset`

Presets are predefined sets of image modifiers that can be used create unified form of images in your projects.

::alert{type="info"}
  We can define presets using [presets options](/configuration#presets) in `nuxt.config`
::

::code-group

  ```html [index.vue]
  <template>
    <nuxt-img preset="cover" src="/nuxt-icon.png" />
  </template>
  ```

  ```ts [nuxt.config.js]
  export default {
    image: {
      presets: {
        cover: {
          modifiers: {
            fit: "cover",
            format: "jpg",
            width: 300,
            height: 300,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  };
  ```

::

### `format`

In case you want to serve images in a specific format, use this prop.

```html
<nuxt-img format="webp" src="/nuxt-icon.png" ... />
```

Available formats are `webp`, `avif`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, `gif` and `svg`. If the format is not specified, it will respect the default image format.

### `quality`

The quality for the generated image(s).

```html
<nuxt-img src="/nuxt.jpg" quality="80" width="200" height="100" />
```

### `fit`

The `fit` property specifies the size of the images.
There are five standard values you can use with this property.

- `cover`: (default) Preserving aspect ratio, ensure the image covers both provided dimensions by cropping/clipping to fit
- `contain`: Preserving aspect ratio, contain within both provided dimensions using "letterboxing" where necessary.
- `fill`: Ignore the aspect ratio of the input and stretch to both provided dimensions.
- `inside`: Preserving aspect ratio, resize the image to be as large as possible while ensuring its dimensions are less than or equal to both those specified.
- `outside`: Preserving aspect ratio, resize the image to be as small as possible while ensuring its dimensions are greater than or equal to both those specified.

```html
<nuxt-img fit="cover" src="/nuxt-icon.png" width="200" height="100" />
```

::alert{type="info"}
Some providers support other values
::

### `modifiers`

In addition to the standard modifiers, each provider might have its own additional modifiers. Because these modifiers depend on the provider, refer to its documentation to know what can be used.

Using the `modifiers` prop lets you use any of these transformations.

**Example:**

```html
<nuxt-img
  provider="cloudinary"
  src="/remote/nuxt-org/blog/going-full-static/main.png"
  width="300"
  height="169"
  :modifiers="{ roundCorner: '0:100' }"
/>
```

### `preload`

In case you want to preload the image, use this prop. This will place a corresponding `link` tag in the page's head.

```html
<nuxt-img preload src="/nuxt-icon.png" />
```

### `loading`

This is a [native](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/loading) attribute that provides a hint
to the browser on how to handle the loading of an image which is outside the viewport.
It is [supported](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr) by the latest version of all major browsers since March 2022.

Set `loading="lazy"` to defer loading of an image until it appears in the viewport.

```html
<nuxt-img src="/nuxt-icon.png" loading="lazy" />
```


## Events

Native events emitted by the `<img>` element contained by `<nuxt-img>` and `<nuxt-picture>` components are re-emitted and can be listened to.

**Example:** Listen to the native `onLoad` event from `<nuxt-img>`

```html
<nuxt-img
  src="/images/colors.jpg"
  width="500"
  height="500"
  @load="doSomethingOnLoad"
/>
```
