description: 'Listening to native events emitted by the contained img tag'
---

Native events emitted by the `<img>` element contained by `<nuxt-img>` and `<nuxt-picture>` components are re-emitted and can be listened to.

**Example:** Listen to the native `onLoad` event from `<nuxt-img>`

```html
<nuxt-img
  src="/images/colors.jpg"
  width="500"
  height="500"
  @load="doSomethingOnLoad"
/>
```
