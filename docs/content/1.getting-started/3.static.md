If you are building a static site Nuxt Image will optimize and save your images locally when your site is generated - and deploy them alongside your generated pages. (This only works with server-side rendered pages. If you use `ssr: false`, won't work)

::alert{type="info"}
Even if you are using another provider, you can opt-in to this generate behaviour for a particular image by setting `provider="static"` directly. (See [component documentation](/components/nuxt-img) for more information.)
