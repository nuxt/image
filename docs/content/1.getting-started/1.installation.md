::alert{type="info"}

You are reading the `v1` documentation compatible with **Nuxt 3** (experimental). Check out the [image.nuxtjs.org](https://image.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/installation) for **Nuxt 2** compatible version. ([Announcement](https://github.com/nuxt/image/discussions/548)).

::

Add `@nuxt/image-edge` as a devDependency to your project:

::code-group
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn add --dev @nuxt/image-edge
  ```

  ```bash [npm]
  npm install -D @nuxt/image-edge
  ```
::

Add the module to `buildModules` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/image-edge',
  ]
}
```

::alert{type="success"}
You can now start using [`<nuxt-img>`](/components/nuxt-img) and [`<nuxt-picture>`](/components/nuxt-picture) components in your Nuxt app ✨
::

## Configuration

Add an `image` section in your `nuxt.config.js`:

```ts [nuxt.config.js]
export default {
  image: {
    // Options
  }
}
```

See [module options](/api/options) for available options.

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during installation:

- Ensure using LTS version of NodeJS ([NodeJS Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

- Try to upgrade to latest versions:

::code-group
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn upgrade @nuxt/image-edge
  ```

  ```bash [npm]
  npm up @nuxt/image-edge
  ```
::

- Try recreating lock-file:

::code-group
  ```bash [yarn]
  rm yarn.lock && yarn
  ```

  ```bash [npm]
  rm package-lock.json && npm i
  ```
::

- If there is still an error related to `sharp` and `node-gyp`, it is is probably becase your OS architecture or NodeJS version is not included in pre-built binaries and needs to built from source (for example, this sometimes occurs on Apple M1). Checkout [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for install requirements.

- If none of the above worked, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nuxt/image/issues) and include error trace, OS, Node version and the package manager used for installing.
