::callout
You are reading the `v1` documentation compatible with **Nuxt 3**. :br Checkout [v0.image.nuxtjs.org](https://v0.image.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/installation) for **Nuxt 2** compatible version. ([Announcement](https://github.com/nuxt/image/discussions/548)).
::

Add `@nuxt/image@rc` dependency to your project:

::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @nuxt/image@rc
```
```bash [yarn]
yarn add @nuxt/image@rc
```
```bash [npm]
npm install @nuxt/image@rc
```
::

Add it to `modules` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/image',
  ]
})
```

You can now start using [`<NuxtImg>`](/usage/nuxt-img) and [`<NuxtPicture>`](/usage/nuxt-picture) components in your Nuxt app âœ¨

## Configuration

Add an `image` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
image: {
  // Options
}
```

See the [image configuration](/get-started/configuration) for all available options and features to customize.

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during installation:

- Ensure using LTS version of NodeJS ([NodeJS Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))

- Try to upgrade to latest versions:

::code-group
  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm up @nuxt/image@rc
  ```

  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn upgrade @nuxt/image@rc
  ```

  ```bash [npm]
  npm up @nuxt/image@rc
  ```
::

- Try recreating lock-file:

```bash
npx nuxt@latest upgrade --force
```

- If there is still an error related to `sharp` and `node-gyp`, it is is probably becase your OS architecture or NodeJS version is not included in pre-built binaries and needs to built from source (for example, this sometimes occurs on Apple M1). Checkout [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for install requirements.

- If none of the above worked, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nuxt/image/issues) and include error trace, OS, Node version and the package manager used for installing.
