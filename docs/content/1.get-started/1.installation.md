::note
You are reading the `v1` documentation compatible with **Nuxt 3**. :br Checkout [v0.image.nuxtjs.org](https://v0.image.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/installation) for **Nuxt 2** compatible version. ([Announcement](https://github.com/nuxt/image/discussions/548)).
::

## Automatic Installation

To get started, add `@nuxt/image` to your project:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add image
```

## Manual Installation

Add `@nuxt/image` dependency to your project:

::code-group
```bash [npm]
npm i @nuxt/image
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @nuxt/image
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @nuxt/image
```

```bash [bun]
bun add @nuxt/image
```
::

Then, add it to the `modules` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxt/image'
  ]
})
```

## Configuration

Add an `image` section in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  image: {
    // Options
  }
})
```

::tip
Checkout the [image configuration](/get-started/configuration) for all available options and features to customize.

## Edge Channel

After each commit is merged into the `main` branch of `@nuxt/image` and **passing all tests**, we trigger an automated npm release using GitHub Actions publishing a [`@nuxt/image-nightly`](https://npmjs.com/package/@nuxt/image-nightly) package.

You can opt in to use this release channel and avoid waiting for the next release and helping the module by beta testing changes.

The build and publishing method and quality of edge releases are the same as stable ones. The only difference is that you should often check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nuxt/image) for updates. There is a slight chance of regressions not being caught during the review process and by the automated tests. Therefore, we internally use this channel to double-check everything before each release.

### Opting into the edge channel

Update `@nuxt/image` dependency inside `package.json`:

```diff [package.json]
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "@nuxt/image": "^1.0.0"
+   "@nuxt/image": "npm:@nuxt/image-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```

Remove lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and reinstall dependencies.

### Opting out from the edge channel

Update `@nuxt/image` dependency inside `package.json`:

```diff [package.json]
{
  "devDependencies": {
-   "@nuxt/image": "npm:@nuxt/image-nightly@latest"
+   "@nuxt/image": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Remove lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and reinstall dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during installation:

- Ensure using LTS version of NodeJS ([NodeJS Download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download))
- Try to upgrade to latest versions:

::div
  :::code-group
  ```bash [npm]
  npm up @nuxt/image
  ```
  
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn upgrade @nuxt/image
  ```
  
  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm up @nuxt/image
  ```
  
  ```bash [bun]
  bun update @nuxt/image
  ```
  :::
::

- Try recreating lockfile:

::div
```bash
npx nuxi@latest upgrade --force
```
::

- If there is still an error related to `sharp` and `node-gyp`, it is probably because your OS architecture or NodeJS version is not included in pre-built binaries and needs to be built from source (for example, this sometimes occurs on Apple M1). Checkout [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for install requirements.
- If none of the above worked, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nuxt/image/issues) and include error trace, OS, Node version and the package manager used for installing.
