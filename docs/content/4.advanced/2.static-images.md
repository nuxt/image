title: Static Images
description: Optimizing images for static websites.
---

If you are building a static site using `nuxt generate`, Nuxt Image will optimize and save your images locally when your site is generated - and deploy them alongside your generated pages.

If you disabled server-side rendering (`ssr: false` in the `nuxt.config`), Nuxt Image won't be able to optimize your images during the static generation process.

In that case, you can tell Nuxt to pre-render images by using the `nitro.prerender.routes` option:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false,
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      routes: [
        '/_ipx/w_120/market.jpg',
        '/_ipx/w_140/market.jpg',
        // etc.
      ]
    }
  }
})
```
